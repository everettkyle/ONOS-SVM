# ONOS-SVM
Using ONOS and an SVM to detect anomalous behavior in IoT devices

This repo will be to provide general knowledge on how to install and use the ONOS platform.
I will also provide multiple useful commands for the CLI, GUI, and Docker that will speed up 
the process of development.

## ONOS-Installation (via Docker)
If you don't have docker already installed Digital Ocean has a great tutorial
that you can follow.
